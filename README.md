# Free Code Camp - Scientific Computing with Python

"In the Scientific Computing with Python Certification, you'll learn Python fundamentals like variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. Then you'll quickly ramp up to complex data structures, networking, relational databases, and data visualization." freeCodeCamp

This repo contains my code for the 5 projects at the end of the course that need to be completed, using the skills developed during the ~300hr course, to recieve the certification.
